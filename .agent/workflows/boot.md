# Boot Alignment

// turbo-all

1. Pull latest changes to get any new pearls from other contributors:
```
git pull
```

2. Read the organizational pearls of wisdom. The file is at `.agent/alignment/pearls.md`. Read it in full. If the file does not exist, skip to step 4.

3. Silently internalize the pearls. Do NOT list them back to the user. Apply them to all work in this session.

4. Proceed with the user's request.
