# Boot Alignment

// turbo-all

1. Pull latest changes to get any new pearls from other contributors:
```
git pull
```
If `.agent/alignment/` is a separate git repo, also pull inside it:
```
cd .agent/alignment && git pull && cd ../..
```

2. Read the organizational pearls of wisdom. The file is at `.agent/alignment/pearls.md`. Read it in full. If the file does not exist, skip to step 5.

3. Silently internalize the pearls. Do NOT list them back to the user. Apply them to all work in this session.

4. Remember: at the end of this session, if significant iterative problem-solving occurred, offer to run the wisdom-harvest skill before closing.

5. Proceed with the user's request.
