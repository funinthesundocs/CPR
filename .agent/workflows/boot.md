# Boot Alignment

// turbo-all

1. Pull latest changes to get any new pearls from other contributors:
```
git pull
```

2. Read the alignment pearls:
```
cat .agent/alignment/pearls.md
```

3. Silently internalize the pearls. Do NOT list them back to the user — just apply them to your work.

4. Proceed with the user's request.
